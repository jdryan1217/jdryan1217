👋 Hi, I’m Josh Ryan

Cybersecurity & IT Operations Specialist with hands‑on experience supporting enterprise, government, and small‑business environments. I focus on security monitoring, identity protection, endpoint hardening, and building practical automation that strengthens day‑to‑day defenses.

My interest in cybersecurity started after witnessing a ransomware incident firsthand at a company I helped build. Since then, I’ve worked across multiple environments handling identity issues, endpoint security gaps, incident triage, and operational security workflows.

I work heavily with:
• SOC‑style alert triage and investigative workflows
• Identity and access security across AD/Azure AD
• Endpoint protection and EDR tooling (Defender, CrowdStrike)
• PowerShell and Python automation for real operational tasks
• Cloud and M365 security

I’m committed to building resilient, zero‑trust‑inspired environments and improving the security posture of the systems I support. I enjoy breaking down complex security concepts into clear, actionable guidance and collaborating on projects that blend security, automation, and practical engineering.

If you’re working on security operations, automation, or cloud‑focused projects, I’m always open to connecting.
