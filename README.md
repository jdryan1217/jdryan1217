- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Josh Ryan
- Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity and all the latest tech gear.
- Iâ€™m currently learning the most relevent cybersecurity tools, programs and languages.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building as close to a zero trust policy on my personal and business infrastructor as possible.


My passion for cybersecurity began the day the company I helped build got hacked. Being able to see, first hand, what a ransomware attack can do really opened my eyes to the world of cybersecurity.

This industry sees no sign of stopping anytime soon and the need for Infosec has never been more dire. This is why I have dedicated my free time to learning everything there is to know about the broad array of technologies surrounding our everyday lives. I decided to start with the cybersecurity bootcamp at the University of Denver and my study for the CompTIA Security+ Certification. Now, all I seem to listen to is cybersecurity podcasts and youtube channels. An obsession with cloud and networking has started and I hope to inspire more to follow suit as we now have battlefronts via keyboards and command lines as well. I hope you join me and get, at least, a basic understanding of phishing and the vulnerabilities we all have with the tools we use now everyday.
